                            <p class="text">Innova is a new generation training institute focusing on  all aspects of information technology and business administration.<br />
  The Innova Institute of Sciences is the Peshawar&rsquo;s first  professional body for IT training professionals. It was established in 2001 and  since then has grown on an annual basis where it is now firmly established as  the leading Training Center throughout the NWFP and Punjab on IT training and  development.<br />
The Innova Institute of Sciences exists to continuously  raise standards of professionalism within the training industry. </p>
                            <p class="text">Through an unrivalled range of membership, certification,  accreditation, events and bespoke consultancy services, the Institute focuses  on enhancing and recognizing the skills and professional status of individuals  and organizations engaged in training activities, and assessing the quality of  training services.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p class="text">Three guiding principles drive the Innova Institute of  Sciences.</p>
                            <p class="text"><strong>Professional recognition</strong><br />
                              Our focus is fixed firmly on promoting the prestige and  integrity of the IT training profession. Certification, Membership,  Accreditation and Consultancy through the Institute not only establishes the  quality of training individuals, organizations and programmes, but sets our  members and client organizations on the path to sustained business improvement.</p>
                            <p class="text"><strong>An independent view</strong></p>
                            <p class="text">The Institute is a self-determining, objective body. Being  vendor neutral means we can concentrate unhindered on the development of  professional standards. Our impartial viewpoint means we are uniquely  positioned to establish and monitor benchmarks of excellence: standards against  which we can measure the performance of training professionals. <br />
                                <strong>Sharing best practice and excellence</strong><br />
                              Through an extensive schedule of member events, seminars,  conferences and awards we bring industry professionals together to learn, share  and recognize best practice. Members of the Institute also benefit from the  combined purchasing power of a growing body of professionals.</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li class="text">We  provide trenchant knowledge and experience that is absolutely vital for  developing the performance and reputation of today's forward-thinking training  professionals.</li>
                              <li class="text">We  evaluate ability against a core set of training skills and disciplines, through  which we monitor and maintain the status of the industry.</li>
                              <li class="text">We devise  coherent and consensual approaches to the profession's development, providing  both training quality and results for the business community.</li>
                              <li class="text">We  empower training professionals to facilitate measurable performance improvement  for their organization.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="text">In short, the Institute helps prepare classroom trainers,  designers and developers of learning materials, online tutors, training  managers and consultants to equip business for success in the new global  economy.</p>                         </td>
